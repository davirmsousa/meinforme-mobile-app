# meinforme-mobile-app

*This is a project coded to scientific research in high school.*

## 1. The Problem
We lived this. How much times we lost some important date or event in school because we lost a paper with a notice or forgot after hear (for a long time) someone say sonmething?

The MeInfome app comes to resolve this (or try ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).

## 2. The Solution
Tecnology is the present, with this we can be wonderful things, then why we wont use this in high school?

Using an app and a web plataform we can facilitate the communication and made this quick and easy.

## 3. The Project
The project is compose for 2 pataforms: Web and Mobile:

- The Web Plataform is directed to school where he can send notices and see the *Talk with us* sended by students.

- The Mobile Plataform is directed to student where he can see the notices sended by school and send the *Talk with us*.

## 3.1 Mobile app
The mobile, currently, is coded in native android language (Java) but i want to expand this to IOS (using Swift or rebuilding the app with Ionic).
